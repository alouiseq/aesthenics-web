# Motivation ---------

A fitness app should be fun, easy to follow, and educational. This web app strives to hit all 3 phases.

# UI Screens --------

## Library Screen
Displays all the exercises available.
- 2 view options:
  - all exercises (alphabetical order)
  - exercises displayed as sections which are filtered by exercise type

## Workout Schedule Screen
Displays the workout schedule currently available for the user
- 2 view options:
  - weekly schedule (can be sorted by recent to oldest or vice versa)
  - daily schedule (default to the current schedule/day)

## Daily Schedule View
Workout schedule for the day.
- Dropdown option to select a day (defaults to the current day)
- Editable - has CRUD options for setting workouts

## Side Panel View
Panel available for all the screens that contains options/configurations for the current screen.


## Reach for the Stars ---------
- Display a user avatar that provide the user a visual representation of their progress (gamification). The idea is that the avatar can grow and give the visuals of "getting more fit".
- Badging/ranking system for users for their progress (should be an alternative if the above is not feasible - maybe start with this as implemenation would be simpler)
- Allow for social sharing of workouts for a more interactivity, fun, and motivation.


## Improvements ----------

### Daily Schedule View
- ability to add to favorites
- ability to save the daily card to be shared with other users
